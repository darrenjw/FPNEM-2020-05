# Continuous time and stochastic modelling of epidemic processes

Some more advanced modelling of epidemics, but skipping over all of the maths.

Again, it's a Scala `sbt` project. `sbt run` will run a demo, `sbt mdoc` will compile the docs, `sbt console` will give a REPL to follow along interactively.

There's a `Makefile`, and `make` will build all of the presentation material.

* Part 3: Modelling epidemics in continuous time and using stochastic processes - [mdoc](docs/Stochastic.md), [md](target/mdoc/Stochastic.md), [PDF slides](target/mdoc/Stochastic.pdf)

For anyone who is interested in the underpinning maths, [read my book!](https://github.com/darrenjw/smfsb/blob/master/README.md)
