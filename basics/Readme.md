# Modelling basics

A quick introduction to modelling growth and epidemic processes without any calculus or probability theory.

This is a Scala `sbt` project. Doing `sbt run` will run a demo, and `sbt mdoc` will compile the [mdoc](https://scalameta.org/mdoc/) markdown files in [docs](docs/).

There's also a `Makefile` in here, so just typing `make` should build all of the presentation material.
